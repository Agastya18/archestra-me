/**
 * TODO: what is the proper type on this? It used to be thisðŸ‘‡
 *
 * import type { ToolCall as BaseToolCall } from '@clients/archestra/api/gen';
 *
 * However, we're no longer exporting a ToolCall type as part of the API's openapi schema.
 * We used to do this with the Rust backend.. what does a ToolCall represent now?
 *
 * Two approaches we can take here:
 * 1. Import the type from the relevant (which one?) package
 * 2. Generate the zod schema/type on the backend, and "register" it as a "component" in the openapi spec
 * such that it would get codegen'd into @clients/archestra/api/gen/types.gen.ts
 * (see calls to z.globalRegistry.add for an example of how to do this)
